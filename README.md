### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have been programming professionally since my apprenticeship as an IT specialist for application development in August 2021. Before that I mainly programmed privately for many years, which I still do to this day. Nevertheless, since my apprenticeship I have been able to expand and deepen my previous knowledge enormously, as well as discover new technologies and learn new programming languages.

C# and Python in particular are among the programming languages â€‹â€‹in which I have the most experience. Furthermore, I have very good knowledge of SQL, HTML5 and CSS3.
